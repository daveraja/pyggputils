GGP utilities and functions for Python

Currently it only implements the protocol for communicating to a GGP
game server/controller.  The main dependency, beyond the usual python
packages, is the gevent library.

Note: Very beta at the moment. I need to create a setup script to
install properly, but for the moment just set the PYTHONPATH to point
to the 'src' directory. Also need to create proper testing.

There is an example on how to use the API in the example directory.
